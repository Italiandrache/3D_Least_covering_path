# 3D_Least_covering_path
Python script to determine a least covering path in a uniform 2D/3D rectangular point grid.
The algorithm is WIP and does not work yet.
A least covering path is defined as a path made out of the least number of continuously connected line segments that cover all the points that compose the grid.
